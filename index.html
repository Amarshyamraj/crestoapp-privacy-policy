  <h1>Crestoapp Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 11, 2024</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Crestoapp (the "App") is a mobile application developed and operated by Cresto (Yet to be incorporated) ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your information in connection with your use of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We collect two types of information through the App:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Permissions:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> You may be prompted to grant the App permission to access your device's camera. We only request this permission if you choose to take a profile picture directly through the App. The captured image will be used solely for your profile picture within the App and will not be shared with any third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Gallery:</strong> You may be prompted to grant the App permission to access your device's photo gallery. We only request this permission if you choose to upload a profile picture from your existing photos. The photos you select will be used solely for your profile picture within the App and will not be accessed or stored by us beyond that purpose.</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>We may collect some limited usage data about your interaction with the App. This data may include information such as the features you access, the frequency of your use, and any crash reports. This data is used solely for internal purposes to improve the App and is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To allow you to set and manage your profile picture within the App.</li>
    <li>To improve the App and develop new features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share your information with any third party except in the following limited circumstances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may work with third-party service providers to help us operate and improve the App. These providers may have access to your information only to the extent necessary to perform their services and are obligated to handle your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or protect the rights or safety of ourselves or others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
